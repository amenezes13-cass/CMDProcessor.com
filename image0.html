        <h1>Welcome to Commodity Processor!</h1>
        <h1>A message from António!</h1>
        <p>
          Dear Traders,

          A very warm welcome to CMD_Processor, a trading course brought to you with the purpose of creating a better understanding of the Financial Markets and the tools that you need to become a successful trader across different assets.

        <p>
          These are extremely unique circumstances which has shaped the way that people interact hence, we will be adopting an online delivery method whereby you will be provided with pre-recorded lectures and will have acess to one-to-one consultations.
          To me, there is nothing more satisfying than giving back to the community and after combining my Bachelor degree in Petroleum Engineering with a Masters in Energy, Trade and Finance and a heavy dose of Trading; I find myself in the position to share those with you.
    
        <p>
          We will combine the concept of Fundamental and Technical analysis to break down events within the market as well as important Fundamentals of Behavioral Psychology that every trader should be aware of.
          This will be finalised with the development of a suitable trading strategy with the correct risk Management rules in place.

          <p>
          I hope this course will be benefitial to you!

          Yours,
        </p>
